Thank you [@Natsumi](https://github.com/coooopeeeer) for designing all layouts of WakeMeApp. The design is really well-organized, user-friendly, and beautiful.  
When I first told you the idea, you immediately understood the concepts and gave me a lot of advice as a designer. Whenever I asked you for additional design work, you were always flexible and dealt with my requests.
Thank you so much for your help, and please let me know if I can return the favor!
